    <h3>Topics</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the account of COVID-19, it is seen that there is a shortage of beds and the remdesivir injection. Propose a solution/idea to tackle the same.</li>
        <li>Women safety is seen as a huge concern in today's world. Propose a solution to ensure the safety of women on all platforms</li>
        <li>Globally the number of people of all ages visually impaired is estimated to be 285 million, of whom 39 million are blind. People 50 years and older are 82% of all blind. Everyone should have access to technology, propose a solution/idea to help the visually impaired population have access to the Internet</li>
        <li>Ambulances are often seen to be stuck in congestion on the roads. Even though Traffic signals in India have been designed to turn Green upon hearing the siren from a particular distance, it is often seen that they do not go green. It is only after the chorus of honking reaches someone controlling the signals, does the signal turn green. Propose a solution/idea to solve this problem so that timely treatment can be given to those who need it.</li>
        <li>According to a study in 2018, 313 million illiterate people are there in India, education has great potential to change the world when a society is educated, there is a great allocative and productive efficiency with rapid rates of development. Suggest ways to educate the illiterate people.</li>
        <li>According to a recent study, 8 million metric tonnes of plastic are dumped into the oceans each year. Statistics suggest that by the year 2050, ocean plastic will outweigh all of the ocean's fish. Suggest solutions/ideas to minimize the usage of plastics to a bare minimum and how we can possibly clean up water bodies to make them sustainable for marine life.</li>
        <li>There are millions of elderly people who are targeted for phishing attacks and scams. Suggest ways to reduce such scams.</li>
        <li>The COVID-19 pandemic is increasing demand for mental health services, according to a new WHO survey. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, it is important that we look after our mental, as well as our physical health. Propose a solution/idea to solve this problem.</li>
        <li>A lot of scams are taking place regarding the availability of remdesivir, some sellers are pricing the injection at high prices just to make profit out of those who are desperate to buy it. Propose a solution/idea to reduce the scams to ensure they are sold at the rate suggested by the government.</li>
        <li>In stores/malls/supermarkets we often spend a lot of time in lines in order to get our items billed which can be time consuming and can be considered dangerous taking COVID-19 into account. Propose a solution to reduce the time we spend for the billing procedure</li>
        <li>Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, many small businesses like eateries and grocery stores have been badly affected. With almost no profit, such small businesses are being forced to shut down. One way to help save these businesses is by requesting the public to make small donations or to help in delivery of food and/or groceries to the people who have been affected with Covid and cannot step out of their homes. Propose a way to solve this problem.</li>
        <li>The amount of food being discarded in hotels is usually either underestimated or simply ignored. According to the UN FAO, one third of food produced is wasted each year, which means approximately 3.6 million tonnes of food are being thrown away each day. Propose a solution/idea to solve this problem.</li>
        <li>Water is a life giver. Nowadays, there is a shortage of water everywhere. With the rising sea levels and pollution of freshwater sources, people are forced to buy water at expensive prices. Propose ideas to preserve water and to use water filtration to convert sea water into fresh drinkable water.</li>
        <li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that in the US in 2015, there were 146,571 "unintentional injury deaths" that year, the fourth leading cause of death. Out of the above number 37,757 were from traffic accidents. Propose a solution to make roads safer for the drivers as well as the pedestrians.</li>
        <li>In this digital era, data is the new oil. Companies compete to get user data of the people who access their platforms and sell our data to make money. Since our lives now are bounded by electronic devices, there is no shortage of data. Propose ways to keep our data safe and how we can reduce the access that these devices and/or applications have on our personal data.</li>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The main objective of this event is to provide innovative ideas/solutions to solve pre-selected problem statements. The ideas are to be documented and presented on the respective dates.<br>On the day of the presentation, a demo is to be given. Taking this into account, participants may come up with a Web Application and/or Android Application and/or a UI design as to how their innovation would work if implemented. Design of the product depends on the idea and can be presented as a simple Interface or a hand drawn design showcasing how the idea would solve the problem at hand.<br>In the occasion that the idea cannot be presented as the above mentioned methods, participants may use any medium to put forth their ideas, it can be in the form of Videos/Graphics/Models/Computer Aided Designs (CAD), presentations or any other creative means.</p>
